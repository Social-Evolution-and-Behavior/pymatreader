    Assert that two complex structures have almost equal contents.

    Compares lists, dicts and tuples recursively. Checks numeric values
    using test_case's :py:meth:`unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual` and
    checks all other values with :py:meth:`unittest.TestCase.assertEqual`.
    Accepts additional positional and keyword arguments and pass those
    intact to assertAlmostEqual() (that's how you specify comparison
    precision).
